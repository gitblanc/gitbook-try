## Variables
---
- **Bash** works with space separation, so don't put them allways
- Example:
````
#setting variables
username=bob #don't put spaces

#reading variables
echo "$username"

#delimiting variables
echo "${username}s"
````
- Positional parameters:
````
$1, $2, ... ${10}

#$0 is not positional but represents the script name
````

---
- Let's create a script:
````
$ vim manage_users

#!/bin/bash

#prints the first variable passed in command line
echo "$1"

#prints how many variables there are
echo "$#"

#prints all the variables passed
echo "$*"

#prints the name of the file
echo "$0"

````
- Now, call it
````
$ ./manage_users fred s a w w s 

fred
6
fred s a w w s
./manage_users

````
---
## Providing default values

````
#!/bin/bash

#prints` the first variable passed in command line
user_name="$1"
user_password="${2:-Password1}"
echo "$user_name $user_password"

````
---
## Prompt for user input
````
#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter a username: " username
#The option -s doesn't show the info on the screen
read -sp "Enter a password: " passwd
echo -e "\n$username $passwd"

````

````
$ ./manage_users.sh     

Enter a username: hey
Enter a password: 
hey sdoaeifhj

````

## Script Logics
````
#!/bin/bash 

#if they are the same
if [ $# -eq 0 ] ; then

        read -p "Enter a username: " username
        #The option -s doesn't show the info on the screen
        read -sp "Enter a password: " passwd
        read -sp "Confirm your password: " passwd_confirm
        echo ""

        if [ $passwd != $passwd_confirm ] ; then
                echo -e "\n${0}: Passwords do not match!"
                exit 1
        fi
else
        username="$1"
        passwd="${2:-defaultpasswd}"
fi
echo -e "\n$username $passwd"
