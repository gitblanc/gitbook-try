There are 3 ways to capture traffic from a target device on a switched network:

- **ARP cache poisoning or Man in the middle attack**
- **Using a Network Tab** (device that you oput between two points on your cable system to capture the packets between those two points)
- **Port mirroring or port scanning** (you need a console access to the switch)


In Cisco switch command line put:
````
show ip interface brief

configure terminal

monitor session 1 source interface fastEthernet 1/1 #port 1, where our sniffer is sitting

monitor session 1 destination interface fastEthernet 1/2

session 1 #to check
