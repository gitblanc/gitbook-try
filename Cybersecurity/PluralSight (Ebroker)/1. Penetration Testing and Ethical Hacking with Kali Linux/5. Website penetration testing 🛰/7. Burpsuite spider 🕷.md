The first thing to do for web application testing is to spider the host. This means that Burpsuite will crawl through the whole website and record all the different files on that site. We do this for identifying where the links are, what types of parameters are used in the application, what external sites the application references too and the overall layout of how the app functions.

- Go to target tab and site map tab
- Right click on the domain that you added to your scope
- Click on spider this branch 

(this is only available on the pro Burp version)
