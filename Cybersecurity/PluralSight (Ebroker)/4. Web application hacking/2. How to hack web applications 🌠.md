# Web application concepts
- **Web application**: application running on a server. Is available for the clients over the network and it's often directly accesible by html and accesible to an API

### Terminology
- **Encoding schemes**: a transformation of a representation to another representation (> converts to &gt)
- **URL encoding**: (? converts to %3F)
- **Web 2.0**: it's a ore interactive version of the web
- **Secure application development**

# Web application threats
We should cover the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Top 10. This is a top 10 of most critical application security risks. It is released more less each 3 years.

## OWASP Top 10 2021
1. **Broken access control** (regular user able to perform administrator actions)
2. **Cryptographic failures** (missing or incorrectly applied cryptography)
3. **Injection** (been able to inject content or modify controls and contents)
4. **Insecure design** (missing or ineffective control design)รง
5. **Security misconfiguration** (e.g: no hardening, which means default credentials)
6. **Vulnerable and outdated components**
7. **Identification and authentication failures** (allowing weak passwords)
8. **Software and data integrity failures** (make sure you use an uncompromised software and the integrity is still intact)
9. **Security loggin and monitoring failures** (not being able to detect a breach in real time)
10. **Server-Side request forgery** (the server fetches a remote resource without validating it)

# Web applications attacks
- **Cross-site scripting** (XSS): an attacker is able to inject JavaScript into an object or a page and the Javascript will be executed when another user visits that page
- **Parameter tampering**: when you can modify URL or HTTP parameters (e.g: username stored in the cookie value)
- **Privilege escalation**: escalate your privilege to a one more
- **Insecure Direct Object References** (IDOR): e.g, you got an invoice of a purchase and then you can see other's invoices
- **SQL injection**

# Attack methodology
1. Web application information gathering
2. Identify entry points
3. Bypass client-side controls
4. Vulnerability scanning
5. Exploiting vunerabilities

Attacking an application:

1. Analysis
2. Client-side controls
3. Access controls
4. Authentication mechanisms
5. Sessions management mechanisms
6. Authorization schemes
7. Shared environments
8. Application logic
9. Database credentials

When attacking a web application is needed to use an **intercepting proxy server**

## Web application attack tools
- **Burp Suite** ($ $ $ intercepting proxy server)
- **OWASP Zap** (free intercepting proxy server) 
>sudo apt install zaproxy
- OpenVAS (scans for multiple vulnerabilities)

# Web API's
API stands for Application Programming Interface and allow clients to communicate with servers. Its is basically a set of rules that defines the communication between them.

There are different **protocols** and **models**:
- REST API
- SOAP API
- XML-RPC
- JSON-RPC

# API attack countermeasures
- Use transport layer encryption
- Implement properly access control
- Implement whitelisting
- Limit the request and body size
- Rate limiting
- Implement secure coding

---
# Webhooks and webshells

- **Webhooks** are HTTP-based callback functions that allow communication between diferent API's. They are event-driven, which means thet they fire off a hook when an event occurs. Sometimes they are also known as Reverse or pushed API
- **Webshell** is a backdoor that allows shell access that uses HTTP as transport protocol

# Web application attack countermeasures
- Implement secure coding practices
- Patch managements
- Check logfiles
